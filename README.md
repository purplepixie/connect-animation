# Connect Animation

Connect Animation is a pretty pointless little HTML 5 canvas animation showing moving nodes with connections appearing (and disappearing) between them as they get closer to each other.

See a demo: http://www.purplepixie.org/webapps/html5/connect-animation/

It's quite customisable so size, colours, behaviours etc can all be very easily changed in the setup JS, or of course you can just fork it and do your worst.
